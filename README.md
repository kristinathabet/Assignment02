### User  Testing
The New York State DMV Website is where New York drivers can recieve information, steps, and appointments to renew, replace, make changes to, or get a license. This website also handles all registration for vehicles as well as permits and ID's. This website serves the public by licensing drivers, securing identities, and regualting the vehicle industry.

I will be performing a usability test for the New York DMV website-- specifically the New York Driver License page. The purpose of usability tests is to find new opportunites to improve user experience through interface changes and design choices. Usabilty testing generally improves the website for a users perspective, making the website clearer, easier to navigate, and more pleasant to interact with. Usability testing sessions are going to be recorded for user experience analysis and to reveal potential positive changes that can be made to the website. 

#### For the New York DMV website, the most severe usability issues found from my heursitic evaluation are as follows: 
1. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors: Difficulty pinpointing login errors
2. Visibility of System Status: Difficulty assessing if the website is responsive to the user's cursor
3. User Control and Freedom: Difficulty in filtering search results

I performed this usability test from my apartment using my laptop. I used Zoom to record my usability test. The recording included the screen, audio, me, and the user. This is a pilot usability test and my roomate will be the user. We will be sitting adjacent to each other so I can easliy aid the user if any issues arise.   

#### The process of this usability test is as follows:
1. Consent form to be recordered
2. Introduction of DMV website
3. Background questions about previous knowledge of the website
4. Pre Test questions
5.  Task senarios
6.  Post Test Questions
7.  Demographic Data Questions

#### The following results were measured:
1. Site organization
2. Site responsiveness
3. Ease of use
4. Ease of navigation through the site
5. Overall user experience after interacting with the site

## Reflection: Improving User Testing 
During my pilot test, I learned how important it is for the participant to be fully informed about everything happening during the test. Many different users have different thought processes when navigating websites, so it is important for websites to be as organized and intuitive as possible. Everything went very smoothly except for having to switch back and forth between the google form and DMV website. The tasks I chose were good representations of common actions taken on the website, so it was useful studfy how to simplify doing these tasks. For my UT's in the future, I will make my tasks much more complex and informative so I can assess the website in greater depth. I will add a section of my survey that allows participants write whatever additional information about the website they wish to share. The UT would be stronger if participants had an outlet to express their feelings in their own words rather than filling in multiple choice.
